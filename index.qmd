In the beginnning of the 1994 season, the arc was shortened from 23 ft and 9 inches and 22 feet in the corners to 22 feet all around. This made the 3 pointer an overall slightly easier shot to make, driving up shot volume. However, beginning in the 1997 season, they reverted the 3 point line as while 3 point volume increased, overall scoring decreased \~5 points per game. @cr-sticky01

While the volume of 3 pointers shot has increased steadily since its inception, what might have caused this sharp increase in volume? Over the span of a decade, the average 3 point attempts doubled from 17 shots/game to almost 35.

they also shoot more accurate than the league average over the past 15 years @cr-sticky4

The increase in volume and elite shooting accuracy are one of the key reasons they have won multiple championships in the past 15 years. Additionally, lead by 2 goat shooters, steph and klay.
